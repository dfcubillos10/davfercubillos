## Welcome to my project portfolio

### Websites

- [Imagine](https://imagine.uniandes.edu.co/)
  Imagine site's legacy, partners, and seminars tabs were developed by me, I also added new projects and updated information on the rest of the site.
  
The following websites were developed by me from scratch with the intention to rescue as many resources as possible from their last iteration, which had no maintenance on the previous 5 years:

- [JuegaLibre](https://juegalibre.virtual.uniandes.edu.co/) 

- [Proyecto D.A.V.I.D](https://juegos.virtual.uniandes.edu.co/) 

- [Jumpcamp](https://jumpcamp.virtual.uniandes.edu.co/) 

- [Oro Azul](https://sistemasproyectos.uniandes.edu.co/imagine/MuseoOro/) 

- [Device](https://device.virtual.uniandes.edu.co/) 


### Events and community management

- [Hackathon Uniandes 2020](https://hackathon-uniandes-2020.devpost.com/) 
  I made constant direct communication with every participant via Discord in order to ensure all of them had a group, gave them access to accounts of different technologies such as Twilio and helped them to get a head start on each of them. I also made different media elements for the competition and ensured that all of the competition's rules were followed.

I had complete control over the following forums, where i solved student's doubts, helped grading their peer reviews, and upgraded course metrics regarding weekly work time, session goals, and others.
